# Enrichment of Geospatial Metadata in DANS Archaeology Data Station 
This repository contains the code that was used to research and implement the enrichment of geospatial metadata in the [Archaeology Data Station](https://archaeology.datastations.nl/). The goal is to identify where geospatial metadata in the form of coordinates or toponyms is missing, and how it can be extracted from other parts of the metadata or files. 

Most exploratory work was done in Python Notebooks.
